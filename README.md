# BAKIR -  Biologically-informed Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene annotation tool üß¨

![Test Status](https://github.com/michael-ford/bakir/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bakir/badge/?version=latest)](https://bakir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

`bakir` is a Python tool for gene sequence analysis, specifically focusing on the KIR (Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor) genes. It automates the process of aligning sequences, identifying genes, and annotating them with relevant information such as functional variants and closest matching alleles.

## Features üöÄ

- Sequence alignment and gene identification
- Variant calling and functional annotation
- Selection of best matching alleles through functional varaint identification
- Support for manual annotation fixes through YAML files
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest

## Installation üì¶

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/bakir.git
cd bakir
```
Install the environment with conda:
```
conda env create -f bakir-env.yml
conda activate bakir
```

Install the package (preferably in a virtual environment):
```
pip install .
```

## Usage üõ†
To use bakir, you need to provide the path to your assembly sequence file and the gene database file at a minimum. Additional options allow for customization of the output and other functionalities:

```
usage: bakir [-h] [-d DATABASE] [-o OUTPUT] [-m MAPPING_CACHE] [-t TEMP_DIR] [-f FIXES] sequence

BAKIR: Biologically-informed Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene annotation tool.

positional arguments:
  sequence              Path to the assembly sequence file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DATABASE, --database DATABASE
                        Path to the gene database file.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Optional: Path and prefix for the output file. If not provided, a default name based on the sequence file name will be used.
  -m MAPPING_CACHE, --mapping_cache MAPPING_CACHE
                        Optional: Path for the mapping cache file. If not provided, mapping results will not be cached.
  -t TEMP_DIR, --temp_dir TEMP_DIR
                        Optional: Path for the temporary directory. If not provided, the system default temporary directory will be used.
  -f FIXES, --fixes FIXES
                        Optional: Path to the YAML file containing manual annotation fixes. If not provided, no manual fixes will be applied.
```
